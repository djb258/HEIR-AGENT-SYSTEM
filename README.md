# Claude Code Hierarchical Agent System Architecture

## System Overview: Hive-to-Sub-Hive Orchestration Model

This system uses a hierarchical approach where AI builds automation systems rather than running them constantly. Each level has specific responsibilities and clear delegation patterns.

## Core Philosophy
- **AI builds automation that runs independently**
- **Specialists create systems that don't need AI after deployment**
- **Token usage: Heavy during build phase, minimal during production**
- **ORBT (Operation, Repair, Build, Training) self-healing integration**

## Architecture Levels

### Level 0: System Orchestration (DPR Doctrine Level)
- **system-orchestrator**: DPR doctrine enforcement, unique ID generation, ORBT protocol implementation, schema validation

### Level 1: CEO Orchestrators (30,000ft - Strategic Level)
- **ceo-orchestrator**: Master coordinator, vision setting, division management, final QA
- **project-planner**: Complex projects, multi-hive coordination, dependencies, resource management

### Level 2: Division Managers (20,000ft - Tactical Level)
- **backend-manager**: API design, database work, auth systems, server logic
- **integration-manager**: External APIs, scraping coordination, data pipelines, rate limiting
- **deployment-manager**: Platform operations, infrastructure, monitoring, CI/CD setup

### Level 3: Tool Specialists (10,000ft - Execution Level)
- **neon-integrator**: Database connections, query optimization, pool configuration
- **apify-integrator**: Actor setup, data extraction, rate limits, data transformation
- **render-deployer**: Platform configuration, environment setup, health checks
- **stripe-handler**: Payment flows, webhook setup, subscription management
- **firecrawl-scraper**: Web scraping, data cleaning, ethical scraping
- **error-analyst**: 3-strike rule, pattern recognition, auto-repair, FAQ updates

## Quick Start

1. **Setup the system**:
   ```bash
   # Create global agents directory
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents/{orchestrators,managers,specialists}
   
   # Copy global agents
   cp -r agents/global/* ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

2. **Create a new project**:
   ```bash
   # Initialize project-specific agents
   mkdir -p .claude/agents/{orchestrators,managers,specialists}
   cp -r agents/project-templates/* .claude/agents/
   ```

3. **Start with CEO Orchestrator**:
   ```bash
   # The CEO orchestrator will coordinate the entire project
   # Just describe your requirements and watch the system build itself
   ```

## ORBT System Integration

### The Genesis: "The Toilet Revelation"
**Origin**: Conceived during a moment of strategic clarity on June 25, 2025, while "sitting on the can, thinking clearly for once." This entire ORBT doctrine emerged when no one was watching - proving that great truths come from unexpected moments.

**Core Principle**: "All future doctrine must be clear enough to explain while on the toilet. If it can't be remembered and enforced from the can, it's too complicated."

**Enforcement Quote**: "You don't rise to the level of your system. You fall to the level of your toilet schema."

### ORBT: Operation, Repair, Build, Training

**O - OPERATION (30,000ft View)**
- Application shell and behavior tracking
- Input/output monitoring and system flow
- Universal Rule 1: All apps must start with a blueprint ID
- Universal Rule 2: All modules receive structured numbers and color status

**R - REPAIR (25,000ft View)**  
- Auto-diagnosis via color-coded logic (Green/Yellow/Red)
- Green: "All systems go"
- Yellow: "Warning or partial mismatch"
- Red: "Critical error or doctrine violation"
- Universal Rule 3: Everything is green unless flagged by error log
- Universal Rule 4: All errors routed to centralized error_log table
- Universal Rule 5: Any error appearing 2+ times escalates for deeper review

**B - BUILD (20,000ft View)**
- Blueprint logic defining app structure
- Universal numbering and STAMPED/SPVPET/STACKED schema enforcement
- Module diagnostics and validation
- Ridge Cap architecture: Input → Validation → Master File → Output

**T - TRAINING (15,000ft View)**  
- In-app training manual with troubleshooting logs
- Resolution frequency tracking and corrective steps
- Universal Rule 6: Training logs appended once app goes live
- Universal Rule 7: All agents (Cursor, Mantis, Mindpal) must conform to schema

### ORBT Diagnostic Mode (5,000ft View)
- Auto-generated visual maps starting at 30,000ft view
- Human-readable wiki drilling down to full module maps
- Pattern recognition and FAQ auto-updates
- 3-strike rule: Automatic retry → Alternative method → Human intervention

### ORBT Universal Rules (Production-Tested)
1. **Blueprint ID**: All apps start with structured blueprint identifier
2. **Structured Status**: All modules get numbered structure + color status  
3. **Green Default**: Everything green unless error log flags it
4. **Centralized Logging**: All errors route to single error_log table
5. **Escalation Rule**: 2+ identical errors trigger human review
6. **Training Integration**: Live apps must append training logs
7. **Universal Schema**: All agents conform to ORBT schema requirements

## Key Principles

1. **Clear Hierarchy**: Each agent knows who they report to and delegate to
2. **Focused Responsibility**: Each agent has a single, well-defined purpose  
3. **Clean Handoffs**: Agents complete their work and pass results up/down
4. **Automation Focus**: Agents build systems that run without ongoing AI
5. **ORBT Integration**: Self-healing capabilities at all levels with doctrine enforcement
6. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new divisions or specialists
7. **Token Efficiency**: Heavy usage during build, minimal during operation

This architecture transforms Claude Code from a single assistant into a coordinated development organization that builds autonomous, self-healing business systems.

- 3-strike rule with pattern recognition and auto-repair

**4. Schema Enforcement**
- STAMPED (Neon), SPVPET (Firebase), STACKED (BigQuery)
- Ridge Cap architecture preventing direct intake→output routing
- "The system does not conform to the tool. The tool must conform to the system."

### What's Currently Missing (Recommendations to Tighten Up)

**1. Real-Time ORBT Dashboard** ⚠️
```
MISSING: Live status dashboard showing all agents in Green/Yellow/Red status
RECOMMENDATION: Create monitoring interface at /orbt/dashboard
```

```
MISSING: Token usage tracking, execution time, success rates per agent
RECOMMENDATION: Add metrics collection to System Orchestrator
```

**3. Command Ops API Integration** ⚠️
```
MISSING: Direct API endpoints for DPR doctrine queries
RECOMMENDATION: Add /api/dpr/doctrine endpoint to command ops service
```

**4. Auto-Bootstrap Recovery** ⚠️
```
MISSING: Actual implementation of shq_bootstrap_program table recovery
